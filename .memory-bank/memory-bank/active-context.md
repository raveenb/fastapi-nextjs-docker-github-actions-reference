Investigated Act local testing - works well for basic workflows but has limitations with complex third-party actions and service dependencies.
- [11:18:49 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #18: Successfully created database service with PostgreSQL 16-alpine. Added PostgreSQL to docker-compose with health checks and volumes for persistence. Created comprehensive database initialization scripts with app schema, tables (users, sessions, items, audit_logs, feature_flags), indexes, triggers, and functions. Implemented UUID and pgcrypto extensions, automatic updated_at triggers, and health check functions. Added default admin user and feature flags. Created test script with 22 validation tests, all passing. Configured both production and development database environments with appropriate security settings. Database is fully functional with proper schema structure, data integrity constraints, and performance optimizations. Merged PR #81.
- [11:11:37 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #17: Successfully tested containerized deployment with comprehensive test suite. Created test-deployment.sh script with 31 automated tests across 12 categories including container status, health checks, API endpoints, service communication, performance benchmarks, volume tests, network tests, environment configuration, resource monitoring, and security validation. Fixed docker-compose health check URL. Test results show 27/31 tests passing with excellent performance (3-6ms response times), healthy containers, proper security (non-root users), and optimal memory usage (~50MB backend, ~45MB frontend). Added detailed documentation for test categories and troubleshooting. Merged PR #80.
- [10:54:53 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #16: Successfully created docker-compose.yml for orchestrating backend and frontend services. Implemented production configuration with optimized builds, development configuration with hot reload, comprehensive environment configuration in .env.example, and docker-manage.sh helper script for container management. Features include multi-service orchestration, health checks with proper startup order, network isolation with bridge driver, volume management for logs and cache, and support for both production and development modes. Docker Compose syntax validated and backend builds successfully. Merged PR #79.
- [10:49:57 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #15: Successfully created Dockerfile for frontend with multi-stage builds and security best practices. Implemented three-stage build (deps, builder, runner) using node:20-alpine base image with pnpm package manager. Added non-root user (nextjs) for security, created .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files, and included development Dockerfile with hot reload. Updated next.config.ts for standalone output mode. Build optimizations include multi-stage approach reducing image size, layer caching, and standalone builds. Docker build successful and image optimized. Merged PR #77.
- [10:41:45 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #14: Successfully created Dockerfile for backend with multi-stage builds, security best practices, and optimizations. Created three Dockerfiles: standard multi-stage for production, development with hot reload, and production-optimized with advanced features. Implemented non-root user (fastapi) for security, health checks, uv package manager for faster builds, bytecode compilation, and proper signal handling. Added docker-build.sh helper script with automatic versioning and metadata. Security features include minimal base image, read-only Python files in production, and no unnecessary packages. Optimizations include multi-stage builds reducing image size by ~50%, layer caching, and compiled Python files for faster startup. Merged PR #76.
- [10:19:56 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #13: Successfully created frontend service to call backend. Implemented configuration service for fetching backend config, updated environment variable validation with defaults, created custom React hooks for API data fetching (useHealth, useConfig, useFeatureFlag), added server actions for server-side API calls, and built comprehensive API test page with real-time monitoring of all backend endpoints. The API test page shows health status, readiness checks, liveness probe, and configuration with auto-refresh capabilities and detailed connection information. Full frontend-backend integration is now complete with client-side and server-side data fetching, type-safe API calls, and proper error handling. Merged PR #75.
- [10:14:21 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #12: Successfully built basic layout and home page for the Next.js application. Updated root layout with providers (Theme, Toast), header, and footer components. Created comprehensive home page with hero section, API status monitoring, features grid, and CTA section. Built dashboard page with stats cards, activity feed, system health monitoring, and quick actions. Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme and design tokens. Updated global styles with CSS variables for light/dark mode theming. All pages are responsive and include dark mode support. Merged PR #74.
- [10:08:20 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #11: Successfully created frontend project structure for the Next.js application. Created comprehensive directory structure with components (ui, layout, forms, common), services for API integration, TypeScript type definitions, custom React hooks (useApi, useDebounce, useLocalStorage), React contexts (theme, toast), and configuration files. Implemented base UI components using Radix UI and class-variance-authority. Set up service layer with axios interceptors for auth and error handling. All TypeScript types properly defined, build passes, and development server runs correctly. Merged PR #73.
- [10:00:56 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #10: Successfully installed frontend core dependencies for the Next.js application. Installed UI components (Radix UI, Lucide icons), form handling libraries (react-hook-form, zod), data fetching and state management (SWR, Zustand, axios), utility libraries (clsx, date-fns, tailwind-merge), and testing infrastructure (Jest, Testing Library, Prettier).
