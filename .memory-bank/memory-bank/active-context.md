## Current Session Notes

- [10:14:21 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #12: Successfully built basic layout and home page for the Next.js application. Updated root layout with providers (Theme, Toast), header, and footer components. Created comprehensive home page with hero section, API status monitoring, features grid, and CTA section. Built dashboard page with stats cards, activity feed, system health monitoring, and quick actions. Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme and design tokens. Updated global styles with CSS variables for light/dark mode theming. All pages are responsive and include dark mode support. Merged PR #74.
- [10:08:20 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #11: Successfully created frontend project structure for the Next.js application. Created comprehensive directory structure with components (ui, layout, forms, common), services for API integration, TypeScript type definitions, custom React hooks (useApi, useDebounce, useLocalStorage), React contexts (theme, toast), and configuration files. Implemented base UI components using Radix UI and class-variance-authority. Set up service layer with axios interceptors for auth and error handling. All TypeScript types properly defined, build passes, and development server runs correctly. Merged PR #73.
- [10:00:56 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #10: Successfully installed frontend core dependencies for the Next.js application. Installed UI components (Radix UI, Lucide icons), form handling libraries (react-hook-form, zod), data fetching and state management (SWR, Zustand, axios), utility libraries (clsx, date-fns, tailwind-merge), and testing infrastructure (Jest, Testing Library, Prettier). Created utility functions with tests, configured Jest and Prettier, and updated package.json scripts. All tests passing and build successful. Merged PR #72.
- [9:36:33 PM] [Unknown User] Completed Issue #8: Successfully implemented comprehensive configuration management with environment-based settings, validation, feature flags, configuration API endpoints, and full test coverage. Merged PR #70. Completed Phase 2 (Backend Setup) with Issues #4-8.
