## Update History

- [2025-09-03 10:41:45 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #14: Successfully created Dockerfile for backend with multi-stage builds, security best practices, and optimizations. Created three Dockerfiles: standard multi-stage for production, development with hot reload, and production-optimized with advanced features. Implemented non-root user (fastapi) for security, health checks, uv package manager for faster builds, bytecode compilation, and proper signal handling. Added docker-build.sh helper script with automatic versioning and metadata. Security features include minimal base image, read-only Python files in production, and no unnecessary packages. Optimizations include multi-stage builds reducing image size by ~50%, layer caching, and compiled Python files for faster startup. Merged PR #76.
- [2025-09-03 10:19:56 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #13: Successfully created frontend service to call backend. Implemented configuration service for fetching backend config, updated environment variable validation with defaults, created custom React hooks for API data fetching (useHealth, useConfig, useFeatureFlag), added server actions for server-side API calls, and built comprehensive API test page with real-time monitoring of all backend endpoints. The API test page shows health status, readiness checks, liveness probe, and configuration with auto-refresh capabilities and detailed connection information. Full frontend-backend integration is now complete with client-side and server-side data fetching, type-safe API calls, and proper error handling. Merged PR #75.
- [2025-09-03 10:14:21 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #12: Successfully built basic layout and home page for the Next.js application. Updated root layout with providers (Theme, Toast), header, and footer components. Created comprehensive home page with hero section, API status monitoring, features grid, and CTA section. Built dashboard page with stats cards, activity feed, system health monitoring, and quick actions. Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme and design tokens. Updated global styles with CSS variables for light/dark mode theming. All pages are responsive and include dark mode support. Merged PR #74.
- [2025-09-03 10:08:20 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #11: Successfully created frontend project structure for the Next.js application. Created comprehensive directory structure with components (ui, layout, forms, common), services for API integration, TypeScript type definitions, custom React hooks (useApi, useDebounce, useLocalStorage), React contexts (theme, toast), and configuration files. Implemented base UI components using Radix UI and class-variance-authority. Set up service layer with axios interceptors for auth and error handling. All TypeScript types properly defined, build passes, and development server runs correctly. Merged PR #73.
- [2025-09-03 10:00:56 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #10: Successfully installed frontend core dependencies for the Next.js application. Installed UI components (Radix UI, Lucide icons), form handling libraries (react-hook-form, zod), data fetching and state management (SWR, Zustand, axios), utility libraries (clsx, date-fns, tailwind-merge), and testing infrastructure (Jest, Testing Library, Prettier). Created utility functions with tests, configured Jest and Prettier, and updated package.json scripts. All tests passing and build successful. Merged PR #72.
- [2025-09-03 9:36:33 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #8: Successfully implemented comprehensive configuration management with environment-based settings, validation, feature flags, configuration API endpoints, and full test coverage. Merged PR #70. Completed Phase 2 (Backend Setup) with Issues #4-8.
- [2025-09-03 9:31:58 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #7: Successfully implemented comprehensive health check endpoints with /health, /ready, and /live endpoints, structured response schemas, readiness checks, uptime tracking, and full test coverage. Merged PR #69.
- [2025-09-03 9:28:23 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #6: Successfully created modular FastAPI application structure with proper separation of concerns, app factory pattern, base classes, and comprehensive tests. Merged PR #68.
- [2025-09-03 9:14:34 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Issue #4: Successfully initialized Python project with uv in src/fastapi. Created project structure, configured pyproject.toml with comprehensive settings, added dev dependencies, created tests, and merged PR #66.
