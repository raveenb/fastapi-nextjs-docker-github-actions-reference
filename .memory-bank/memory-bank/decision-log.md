## Technology Stack Selection
- **Date:** 2025-09-03 5:33:29 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Building a reference implementation for modern full-stack development
- **Decision:** Use FastAPI + Next.js with Docker, Terraform, and comprehensive DevOps tooling
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Django + React
  - Express + Vue
  - Ruby on Rails + Angular
- **Consequences:** 
  - Modern async Python backend
  - Type-safe frontend and backend
  - Industry-standard containerization
  - Multi-cloud deployment capability
  - Comprehensive testing strategy
  - Excellent developer experience

## Project Implementation Sequence
- **Date:** 2025-09-03 5:38:25 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Need to build a comprehensive reference repository with many moving parts and dependencies
- **Decision:** Implement in 11 phases with 65 specific tasks, starting with foundation and moving through backend/frontend setup, containerization, features, testing, CI/CD, infrastructure, observability, security, and documentation
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Build everything in parallel
  - Start with infrastructure first
  - Build monolith then split
  - Focus on one cloud provider initially
- **Consequences:** 
  - Clear development path
  - Minimized rework
  - Early validation of integration
  - Incremental complexity
  - Testable at each phase
  - Can stop at any phase and have working system

## Directory Structure Reorganization
- **Date:** 2025-09-03 5:58:57 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Need to organize project structure for clarity and maintainability
- **Decision:** Place all source code under src/ directory with src/fastapi for backend and src/nextjs for frontend
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep backend/ and frontend/ at root
  - Use apps/ directory
  - Use packages/ monorepo structure
- **Consequences:** 
  - Clear separation of source code from config
  - Consistent with modern project structures
  - Easy to locate application code
  - Docker and infrastructure configs remain at root level

## Mandatory Use of context7 MCP Server for Documentation
- **Date:** 2025-09-04 10:30:32 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During development, we identified potential issues with using incorrect or outdated library documentation, which could lead to API mismatches and bugs. The context7 MCP server provides version-specific documentation for libraries.
- **Decision:** Made it MANDATORY to use context7 MCP server for fetching documentation of any package/library being worked on. Must check exact versions from lock files (pyproject.toml, package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, etc.) and fetch version-specific documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Rely on general online documentation
  - Use cached/local documentation
  - Assume API compatibility across versions
- **Consequences:** 
  - Ensures accurate API usage matching installed versions
  - Prevents version mismatch bugs
  - Increases development accuracy
  - Requires additional step in development workflow
  - Guarantees documentation reliability
