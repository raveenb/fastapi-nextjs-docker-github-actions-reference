# System Patterns and Implementation Sequence

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Incremental Development**: Build in small, testable increments
- **Early Integration**: Get end-to-end connectivity working quickly
- **Test-Driven**: Add tests as soon as there's something to test
- **Documentation-Driven**: Document decisions and patterns as we go
- **Dependency-Aware**: Complete prerequisites before dependent tasks

## Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish project structure and documentation
- Repository initialization with proper .gitignore
- Documentation structure (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Memory Bank initialization
- **Deliverable**: Clean project structure ready for development

## Phase 2: Backend Setup (Tasks 4-8)
**Goal**: Minimal working FastAPI application
- Python project with uv package manager
- FastAPI with core dependencies (pydantic, loguru, uvicorn)
- Application structure (routes, models, services)
- Health check endpoint
- Configuration management
- **Deliverable**: Running backend with health endpoint

## Phase 3: Frontend Setup (Tasks 9-13)
**Goal**: Minimal working Next.js application
- Next.js with TypeScript via pnpm
- Core dependencies (zod, pino)
- Project structure (components, services, utils)
- Basic layout and routing
- Backend connectivity service
- **Deliverable**: Frontend that can call backend health endpoint

## Phase 4: Containerization (Tasks 14-18)
**Goal**: Dockerized development environment
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles for both services
- Docker Compose for local development
- Network configuration
- Environment variable management
- End-to-end connectivity testing
- **Deliverable**: Both services running in containers, communicating

## Phase 5: Core Features (Tasks 19-27)
**Goal**: Functional application with real features
- Domain model design (Todo/Task entity)
- Pydantic models for validation
- CRUD REST endpoints
- Database integration
- SSE streaming endpoint
- Frontend components for CRUD
- Zod validation schemas
- Forms with validation
- SSE client implementation
- **Deliverable**: Full-stack CRUD app with real-time updates

## Phase 6: Testing (Tasks 28-34)
**Goal**: Comprehensive test coverage
- Pytest setup with coverage
- Backend unit and integration tests
- Jest configuration
- Frontend component tests
- Cypress E2E tests
- Test scenarios and fixtures
- **Deliverable**: >80% test coverage, passing test suites

## Phase 7: CI/CD Pipeline (Tasks 35-40)
**Goal**: Automated build, test, and release
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Docker image building and registry push
- Act for local CI testing
- Semantic versioning
- Automated releases
- Branch protection rules
- **Deliverable**: Fully automated pipeline from commit to release

## Phase 8: Infrastructure (Tasks 41-49)
**Goal**: Cloud-ready deployment configurations
- Terraform module structure
- AWS infrastructure (ECS/EKS)
- GCP infrastructure (Cloud Run/GKE)
- Digital Ocean Kubernetes
- OVH configuration
- Docker Swarm setup
- Kubernetes manifests
- Traefik load balancing
- Helm charts
- **Deliverable**: Deploy anywhere with Terraform/K8s

## Phase 9: Observability (Tasks 50-55)
**Goal**: Production-grade monitoring and logging
- Loguru integration (backend)
- Pino integration (frontend)
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Prometheus metrics
- Health/readiness endpoints
- Log aggregation
- **Deliverable**: Full observability stack

## Phase 10: Security & Configuration (Tasks 56-58)
**Goal**: Secure secret and configuration management
- GitHub Secrets setup
- CI/CD secret injection
- Environment-specific configs
- **Deliverable**: Secure, environment-aware configuration

## Phase 11: Documentation & Polish (Tasks 59-65)
**Goal**: Production-ready documentation
- Comprehensive README
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- Architecture Decision Records
- Contribution guidelines
- Issue/PR templates
- Deployment guide
- Final validation
- **Deliverable**: Fully documented, ready-to-use template

## Key Dependencies
```
Foundation → Backend/Frontend (can be parallel)
Backend + Frontend → Containerization
Containerization → Core Features
Core Features → Testing
Testing → CI/CD
CI/CD → Infrastructure
Infrastructure → Observability
All → Documentation (ongoing)
```

## Success Metrics Per Phase
1. **Foundation**: Clean structure, documentation exists
2. **Backend**: Health endpoint responds with 200
3. **Frontend**: Page loads, shows backend connectivity
4. **Containerization**: docker-compose up works
5. **Core Features**: CRUD operations work, SSE streams data
6. **Testing**: All tests pass, >80% coverage
7. **CI/CD**: Automated builds succeed, releases are tagged
8. **Infrastructure**: Can deploy to at least one cloud
9. **Observability**: Logs, metrics, and traces are collected
10. **Security**: No secrets in code, configs are external
11. **Documentation**: New developer can start in <15 minutes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't add complexity before basics work
- Don't skip testing "to save time"
- Don't hardcode configuration values
- Don't commit secrets
- Don't create features without tests
- Don't deploy without monitoring
- Don't skip documentation

## Best Practices to Follow
- Commit early and often
- Write tests as you code
- Use environment variables for config
- Structure for testability
- Document decisions as you make them
- Keep services loosely coupled
- Make everything observable
- Automate everything possible
