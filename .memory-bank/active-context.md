# Active Context

## Current Focus
Building a comprehensive reference implementation for modern full-stack development with FastAPI, Next.js, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

## Active Tasks
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank system
- [ ] Set up FastAPI backend structure
- [ ] Configure Next.js frontend
- [ ] Create Docker configuration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows

## Current Issues
None at this time - project initialization phase.

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank initialization
2. Set up backend project structure with uv
3. Initialize frontend with Next.js and TypeScript
4. Create basic Docker configuration
5. Set up initial GitHub Actions workflow

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11+ for FastAPI
- Node.js 20+ for Next.js
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure
- GitHub repository for version control

## Questions/Blockers
None currently.

## Recent Decisions
- Use uv for Python package management (modern, fast)
- Use pnpm for Node.js package management (efficient)
- Implement Memory Bank for project context tracking
- Follow semantic versioning from the start

## Notes
- Project is in initial setup phase
- Following best practices from the beginning
- Emphasis on developer experience with Claude Code + MCP
