# Product Context

## Project Vision
Create a comprehensive reference implementation demonstrating best practices for building, testing, and deploying modern full-stack applications with enterprise-grade DevOps practices.

## Core Objectives
1. **Educational Reference**: Serve as a learning resource for developers
2. **Best Practices Showcase**: Demonstrate industry-standard patterns
3. **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Support deployment across major cloud providers
4. **Developer Experience**: Optimize for productivity with modern tools
5. **Production Ready**: Include all necessary components for real-world deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Backend (FastAPI)
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic V2 for data validation
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Database integration with migrations
- Background job processing

### Frontend (Next.js)
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Server and Client Components
- Zod for runtime validation
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dark mode support
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Responsive design

### Infrastructure
- Docker multi-stage builds
- Docker Swarm and Kubernetes support
- Terraform modules for:
  - AWS (ECS, EKS, RDS, S3)
  - GCP (Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud SQL)
  - OVH Cloud
  - Digital Ocean (App Platform, DOKS)
- Traefik for load balancing
- SSL/TLS with auto-renewal

### DevOps & CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Continuous Integration (lint, test, build)
  - Continuous Deployment (staging, production)
  - Release automation with changelogs
- Act for local CI/CD testing
- Semantic versioning (semver3)
- Automated dependency updates
- Security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing
- Load testing
- Security testing

### Observability
- Structured JSON logging
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Prometheus metrics
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Custom dashboards

### Security Requirements
- Environment-based configuration
- Secrets management via GitHub Secrets
- HTTPS only with security headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting per endpoint

## User Stories

## Success Criteria
1. Complete documentation with examples
2. All tests passing with >80% coverage
3. Successful deployment to at least 2 cloud providers
4. Performance benchmarks documented
5. Security scan passing without critical issues
6. Active community engagement

## Non-Functional Requirements
