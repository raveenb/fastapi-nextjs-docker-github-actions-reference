# Detailed Task Specifications

This document contains comprehensive specifications for all 65 tasks in our FastAPI + Next.js reference implementation project.

## Overview
- **Total Tasks**: 65
- **Phases**: 11
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 months for complete implementation
- **Team Size**: Can be done solo or with a small team

## Phase Summary

1. **Foundation (Tasks 1-3)**: Repository setup and initial structure
2. **Backend Setup (Tasks 4-8)**: FastAPI application foundation
3. **Frontend Setup (Tasks 9-13)**: Next.js application foundation
4. **Containerization (Tasks 14-18)**: Docker configuration and orchestration
5. **Core Features (Tasks 19-27)**: CRUD operations and real-time features
6. **Testing (Tasks 28-34)**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **CI/CD Pipeline (Tasks 35-40)**: Automation and deployment pipelines
8. **Infrastructure (Tasks 41-49)**: Cloud infrastructure and orchestration
9. **Observability (Tasks 50-55)**: Logging, monitoring, and tracing
10. **Security & Config (Tasks 56-58)**: Secret management and configuration
11. **Documentation (Tasks 59-65)**: Complete documentation and validation

## Key Implementation Principles

### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Build in small, working increments
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests as features are built
- **Documentation-First**: Document as we go
- **Security-First**: Consider security at every step

### Quality Standards
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Documentation**: Every feature documented

### Technical Standards
- **Python**: Black, isort, mypy for code quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds, <200MB images
- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade configurations
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment

## Success Criteria for Project

1. **Functional**: All CRUD operations work, real-time updates functional
2. **Performance**: <100ms API response time, <3s page load
3. **Scalable**: Handles 1000+ concurrent users
4. **Maintainable**: Clear code structure, comprehensive tests
5. **Deployable**: One-command deployment to any cloud
6. **Observable**: Full visibility into system behavior
7. **Secure**: No vulnerabilities, secrets properly managed
8. **Documented**: New developer productive in <1 hour

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency conflicts**: Use lock files, test thoroughly
- **Performance issues**: Profile early, optimize continuously
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular scanning, dependency updates
- **Compatibility issues**: Test across platforms

### Process Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined tasks
- **Technical debt**: Refactor as we go
- **Documentation lag**: Document immediately
- **Testing gaps**: Maintain coverage thresholds

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Backend: pytest with 80%+ coverage
- Frontend: Jest with React Testing Library

### Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing
- Database operation testing
- Service communication testing

### E2E Testing
- Critical user paths with Cypress
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing

### Security Testing
- Dependency scanning
- SAST/DAST
- Secret scanning

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**: Local Docker Compose
2. **Staging**: Kubernetes on cloud
3. **Production**: Multi-region deployment

### Release Process
1. Feature branch development
2. PR with tests
3. Automated testing
4. Review and approval
5. Merge to main
6. Automated deployment to staging
7. Manual promotion to production

## Monitoring Strategy

### Metrics
- Application metrics (Prometheus)
- Infrastructure metrics (Cloud provider)
- Business metrics (Custom)

### Logging
- Structured logging (JSON)
- Centralized aggregation
- Log retention policies

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Request flow visualization
- Performance profiling

### Alerting
- Error rate thresholds
- Performance degradation
- Resource utilization
- Security events

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve task specifications
2. Create GitHub issues for each task
3. Set up project board for tracking
4. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
5. Regular progress reviews and adjustments

## Notes

- Tasks can be parallelized where dependencies allow
- Some tasks may require iteration based on findings
- Documentation should be updated continuously
- Security reviews at each phase completion
