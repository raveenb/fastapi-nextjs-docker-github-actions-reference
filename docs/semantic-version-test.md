# Semantic Version Test

This file is created to test the semantic versioning workflow.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Patch Version (fix)**: Bug fixes trigger patch version bump (0.0.1 -> 0.0.2)
2. **Minor Version (feat)**: New features trigger minor version bump (0.0.1 -> 0.1.0)
3. **Major Version (BREAKING)**: Breaking changes trigger major version bump (0.0.1 -> 1.0.0)

## Current Version
- Version: 0.0.1
